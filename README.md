# Adobe Photoshop – User Research Contribution

## Overview  
After my contract with Adobe, I was invited by the Principal Photoshop Product Manager to take part in a user research session. The purpose was to explore early feature concepts and collect user feedback to guide the product direction.

## My Role  
- Participated in a live research session with the **Product Manager, Engineer, and QA Analyst**  
- Tested an early **Point Color** concept  
- Provided workflow insights, feedback on usability, and identified areas for improvement  
- Suggested refinements grounded in real-world usage patterns  

## Outcome  
- The **Point Color** concept was deemed misaligned with user expectations based on collective feedback  
- The team pivoted and shipped the **Adjust Colors** feature instead  
- View the official “Adjust Colors” feature documentation here:

## Impact  
- Contributed to **research-driven product decisions** at Adobe  
- Demonstrated how user feedback can **influence feature direction and pivoting**  
- Gained experience collaborating with cross-functional teams (PM, engineering, QA)
