# Adobe Photoshop – User Research Contribution

## Overview
After my contract stint at Adobe, I was invited by the Principal Photoshop Product Manager (Amy Durocher) to participate in a user research study. The goal was to test early concepts for a new Photoshop feature and gather practitioner feedback to guide product direction.

## My Role
- Joined a live research session with the **Product Manager, Engineer, and QA Analyst**  
- Tested the early **Point Color** feature concept  
- Shared workflow insights and usability feedback based on real-world scenarios  
- Highlighted gaps and opportunities for improvement  

## Outcome
- The original **Point Color** concept was determined (through feedback from myself and others) to be misaligned with user expectations  
- The team pivoted and ultimately shipped the **Adjust Colors** feature to Photoshop users  

## Impact
- Contributed to Adobe’s **research-driven product decision-making**  
- Demonstrated how **user feedback directly shaped feature evolution**  
- Strengthened experience collaborating with **cross-functional product and engineering teams**
